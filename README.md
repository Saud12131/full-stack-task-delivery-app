Food Delivery App
This is a MERN stack food delivery app built as an assignment for the internship at Craft My Plate. The app allows users to browse food items, add them to the cart, and proceed with orders. The project demonstrates the implementation of essential full-stack web development concepts, including frontend design, backend functionality, and seamless state management.

Features
üåü Frontend
Designed using Bootstrap for a clean and responsive UI.
Provides an intuitive interface for users to browse food items and manage their cart.
‚öôÔ∏è Backend
Built with Node.js and Express for a robust server-side architecture.
Includes API endpoints to fetch food items and manage user actions.
üõí Cart Functionality
State management for the cart is implemented using React's useContext hook, allowing users to add, update, and view their cart items in real time.
üóÇÔ∏è Database
MongoDB is used as the database to store food items, user details, and order information.
